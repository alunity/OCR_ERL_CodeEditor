## For running interpreter on command-line                             
Have Python 3.11 installed on your device and added to environment variables. To test, open command prompt and type `python --version`.
I'm assuming you are all using Windows.

Click on 'Code' at top right, click 'download ZIP', extract files, right-click the `interpreter_dependencies` folder and click 'Copy as Path'.
Open start menu and type 'cmd' to open command prompt. In command prompt, type `cd <paste directory path here>` and press Enter.
Type `python interpreter.py <file path of text file containing code>` and press Enter.
